/**
 * The PortableServer::Current interface, derived from
 * CORBA::Current, provides method implementations with
 * access to the identity of the object on which the
 * method was invoked. The Current interface is provided
 * to support servants that implement multiple objects,
 * but can be used within the context of POA-dispatched
 * method invocations on any servant. To provide location
 * transparency, ORBs are required to support use of
 * Current in the context of both locally and remotely
 * invoked operations. An instance of Current can be
 * obtained by the application by issuing the
 * CORBA::ORB::resolve_initial_references("POACurrent")
 * operation. Thereafter, it can be used within the
 * context of a method dispatched by the POA to obtain
 * the POA and ObjectId that identify the object on
 * which that operation was invoked.
