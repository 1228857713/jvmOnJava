/**
    * DynAny objects can be created by invoking operations on the DynAnyFactory object.
    * Generally there are only two ways to create a DynAny object:
    * <UL>
    * <LI>invoking an operation on an existing DynAny object
    * <LI>invoking an operation on a DynAnyFactory object
    * </UL>
    * A constructed DynAny object supports operations that enable the creation of new DynAny
    * objects encapsulating access to the value of some constituent.
    * DynAny objects also support the copy operation for creating new DynAny objects.
    * A reference to the DynAnyFactory object is obtained by calling ORB.resolve_initial_references()
    * with the identifier parameter set to the string constant "DynAnyFactory".
    * <P>Dynamic interpretation of an any usually involves creating a DynAny object using create_dyn_any()
    * as the first step. Depending on the type of the any, the resulting DynAny object reference can be narrowed
    * to a DynFixed, DynStruct, DynSequence, DynArray, DynUnion, DynEnum, or DynValue object reference.
    * <P>Dynamic creation of an any involves creating a DynAny object using create_dyn_any_from_type_code(),
    * passing the TypeCode associated with the value to be created. The returned reference is narrowed to one of
    * the complex types, such as DynStruct, if appropriate. Then, the value can be initialized by means of
    * invoking operations on the resulting object. Finally, the to_any operation can be invoked
    * to create an any value from the constructed DynAny.
