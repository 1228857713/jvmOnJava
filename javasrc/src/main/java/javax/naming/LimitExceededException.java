  * This exception is thrown when a method

  * This is different from a InsufficientResourceException in that
  * LimitExceededException is due to a user/system specified limit.
  * For example, running out of memory to complete the request would
  * be an insufficient resource. The client asking for 10 answers and
  * getting back 11 is a size limit exception.
  *<p>
  * Examples of these limits include client and server configuration
  * limits such as size, time, number of hops, etc.
  * <p>
  * Synchronization and serialization issues that apply to NamingException
  * apply directly here.
