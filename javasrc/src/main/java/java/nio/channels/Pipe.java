/**
 * A pair of channels that implements a unidirectional pipe.
 *
 * <p> A pipe consists of a pair of channels: A writable {@link
 * Pipe.SinkChannel sink} channel and a readable {@link Pipe.SourceChannel source}
 * channel.  Once some bytes are written to the sink channel they can be read
 * from source channel in exactlyAthe order in which they were written.
 *
 * <p> Whether or not a thread writing bytes to a pipe will block until another
 * thread reads those bytes, or some previously-written bytes, from the pipe is
 * system-dependent and therefore unspecified.  Many pipe implementations will
 * buffer up to a certain number of bytes between the sink and source channels,
 * but such buffering should not be assumed.  </p>
