/**
 * A (transparent) specification of the key material
 * that constitutes a cryptographic key.
 *
 * <p>If the key is stored on a hardware device, its
 * specification may contain information that helps identify the key on the
 * device.
 *
 * <P> A key may be specified in an algorithm-specific way, or in an
 * algorithm-independent encoding format (such as ASN.1).
 * For example, a DSA private key may be specified by its components
 * {@code x}, {@code p}, {@code q}, and {@code g}
 * (see {@link DSAPrivateKeySpec}), or it may be
 * specified using its DER encoding
 * (see {@link PKCS8EncodedKeySpec}).
 *
 * <P> This interface contains no methods or constants. Its only purpose
 * is to group (and provide type safety for) all key specifications.
 * All key specifications must implement this interface.
