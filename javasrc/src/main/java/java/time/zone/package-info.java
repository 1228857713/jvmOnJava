 * Support for time-zones and their rules.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Daylight Saving Time and Time-Zones are concepts used by Governments to alter local time.
 * This package provides support for time-zones, their rules and the resulting
 * gaps and overlaps in the local time-line typically caused by Daylight Saving Time.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>Package specification</h3>
 * <p>
 * Unless otherwise noted, passing a null argument to a constructor or method in any class or interface
 * in this package will cause a {@link java.lang.NullPointerException NullPointerException} to be thrown.
 * The Javadoc "@param" definition is used to summarise the null-behavior.
 * The "@throws {@link java.lang.NullPointerException}" is not explicitly documented in each method.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * All calculations should check for numeric overflow and throw either an {@link java.lang.ArithmeticException}
 * or a {@link java.time.DateTimeException}.
 * </p>
 * @since JDK1.8
