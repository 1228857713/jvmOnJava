/**
 * The listener interface for receiving keyboard focus events on
 * a component.
 * The class that is interested in processing a focus event
 * either implements this interface (and all the methods it
 * contains) or extends the abstract <code>FocusAdapter</code> class
 * (overriding only the methods of interest).
 * The listener object created from that class is then registered with a
 * component using the component's <code>addFocusListener</code>
 * method. When the component gains or loses the keyboard focus,
 * the relevant method in the listener object
 * is invoked, and the <code>FocusEvent</code> is passed to it.
