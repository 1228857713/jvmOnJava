/**
 * The listener interface for receiving window events.
 * The class that is interested in processing a window event
 * either implements this interface (and all the methods it
 * contains) or extends the abstract <code>WindowAdapter</code> class
 * (overriding only the methods of interest).
 * The listener object created from that class is then registered with a
 * Window using the window's <code>addWindowListener</code>
 * method. When the window's status changes by virtue of being opened,
 * closed, activated or deactivated, iconified or deiconified,
 * the relevant method in the listener object is invoked, and the
 * <code>WindowEvent</code> is passed to it.
